## Copy This Prompt:

```
I need help creating a comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) testing strategy for my application. Please help me design and implement tests that verify complete user journeys and system workflows.

## Application Context:
- **Application Type**: [Web app, mobile app, desktop app, etc.]
- **Technology Stack**: [Frontend and backend technologies]
- **User Interface**: [Web browser, mobile app, desktop app]
- **Key User Workflows**: [Main user journeys and business processes]
- **Testing Framework**: [Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, etc. - or ask for recommendation]

## Current Testing Setup:
[Describe any existing E2E testing infrastructure and what you've already covered]

## Critical User Workflows:
[List the most important user journeys that need E2E testing coverage]

## E2E Testing Strategy:

Please create a comprehensive E2E testing approach that includes:

### 1. Testing Strategy Overview
- E2E testing scope and objectives
- Test pyramid integration (unit, integration, E2E balance)
- Testing environment setup and requirements
- Browser and device coverage strategy
- Test execution and CI/CD integration

### 2. User Journey Mapping
- **Critical User Paths**: Most important workflows to test
- **Happy Path Scenarios**: Normal user flow testing
- **Edge Case Scenarios**: Unusual but valid user behaviors
- **Error Scenarios**: How users recover from errors
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Compatibility across browsers

### 3. Test Scenarios Design
For each major workflow, create:
- **Complete User Stories**: From login to goal completion
- **Step-by-Step Actions**: Detailed user interaction flows
- **Data Requirements**: Test data needed for each scenario
- **Expected Outcomes**: Success criteria and validations
- **Failure Scenarios**: Error handling and recovery

### 4. Authentication and Authorization Testing
- **User Registration**: Account creation workflows
- **Login/Logout**: Authentication flow testing
- **Password Reset**: Password recovery processes
- **Role-Based Access**: Different user permission levels
- **Session Management**: Session timeout and security

### 5. Core Functionality Testing
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete workflows
- **Form Submissions**: Complex form handling and validation
- **File Operations**: Upload, download, file management
- **Search and Filtering**: Data discovery and manipulation
- **Navigation Testing**: Menu navigation and routing

### 6. Payment and Transaction Testing
- **Checkout Process**: Complete purchase workflows
- **Payment Integration**: Payment gateway testing
- **Order Management**: Order creation and tracking
- **Refund Processing**: Return and refund workflows
- **Subscription Management**: Recurring payment handling

### 7. Mobile and Responsive Testing
- **Mobile Web Testing**: Touch interactions, responsive design
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Phone, tablet, desktop compatibility
- **Orientation Testing**: Portrait and landscape modes
- **Performance on Mobile**: Load times and responsiveness
- **Offline Functionality**: Progressive web app features

### 8. API Integration Testing
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: API call verification
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket, Server-Sent Events
- **External Service Integration**: Third-party API testing
- **Error Handling**: Network failures and API errors
- **Data Synchronization**: Real-time data updates

### 9. Performance and Load Testing
- **Page Load Performance**: Critical page load times
- **User Interaction Speed**: Response times for user actions
- **Concurrent User Testing**: Multiple users simultaneously
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU usage during tests
- **Network Conditions**: Slow network simulation

### 10. Accessibility Testing
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order and keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Screen reader compatibility
- **Color Contrast**: Visual accessibility validation
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper semantic markup
- **Focus Management**: Focus indicator and management

## Test Implementation:

Please provide:
- **Complete test code examples** for major workflows
- **Page Object Model**: Reusable page components
- **Test data management** strategies and fixtures
- **Custom helpers and utilities** for common operations
- **Assertion patterns** for different types of validations

## Test Environment Management:
- **Test data setup and cleanup** procedures
- **Environment configuration** for different test stages
- **Database state management** between tests
- **Mock services** for external dependencies
- **Parallel test execution** strategies

## CI/CD Integration:
- **Automated test execution** in deployment pipeline
- **Test result reporting** and notifications
- **Screenshot and video capture** for failed tests
- **Flaky test handling** and retry strategies
- **Performance regression detection**

## Monitoring and Maintenance:
- **Test result analysis** and reporting
- **Test maintenance** as application evolves
- **Performance trend tracking** over time
- **Coverage analysis** and gap identification
- **Test reliability** and stability improvements

## Advanced Testing Scenarios:
- **Multi-tab testing**: Cross-tab functionality
- **Background processing**: Long-running operations
- **Real-time notifications**: Push notifications, alerts
- **Geolocation testing**: Location-based features
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language testing

## Test Documentation:
- Test case documentation and requirements
- Test data requirements and setup
- Browser and device compatibility matrix
- Known issues and workarounds
- Test execution and debugging guide

Please provide specific, implementable test code that I can run immediately to validate my critical user workflows.

## Tips for Better Results:

- **Map out your critical user journeys** - from entry point to completion
- **Include your application's unique features** - payments, real-time, etc.
- **Specify browser and device requirements** - what you need to support
- **Mention your deployment process** - how E2E tests fit into CI/CD
- **Include performance requirements** - acceptable load times and response times
