## Copy This Prompt:

```
I need help creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for my project. Please guide me through this process by asking me targeted questions one section at a time. Wait for my response before moving to the next section.

Start with these sections in order:

1. **Problem Statement & Vision**
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who experiences this problem?
   - What's our vision for the solution?

2. **Target Users & Use Cases**
   - Who are our primary users?
   - What are their main goals?
   - What are the key user journeys?

3. **Core Features & Requirements**
   - What are the must-have features?
   - What are nice-to-have features?
   - Any technical constraints?

4. **Success Metrics & Goals**
   - How will we measure success?
   - What are our key performance indicators?
   - What's our timeline?

5. **Technical Considerations**
   - Any platform requirements?
   - Integration needs?
   - Scalability expectations?

Please ask 2-3 focused questions for each section, then help me synthesise the information into a well-structured PRD format. Make the questions specific and actionable.

Let's start with the Problem Statement & Vision section.
