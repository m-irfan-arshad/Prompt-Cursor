[DESCRIBE YOUR REQUIREMENTS, FEATURES, OR IDEAS HERE]

## User Story Creation Request:

Please create user stories that follow this structure:

### Story Format:
**As a** [user type]  
**I want** [functionality]  
**So that** [benefit/value]

### For each user story, please include:

#### 1. User Story Details
- Clear, concise story following the standard format
- Specific user persona (end user, admin, guest, etc.)
- Well-defined functionality or feature
- Clear business value or benefit

#### 2. Acceptance Criteria
- Specific, testable conditions that must be met
- Use "Given, When, Then" format where appropriate
- Include both positive and negative scenarios
- Cover edge cases and error conditions

#### 3. Story Specifications
- **Story Points/Effort**: Rough complexity estimate
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low based on business value
- **Dependencies**: Other stories that must be completed first
- **Definition of Done**: What constitutes completion

#### 4. Additional Details
- **Business Rules**: Any specific business logic requirements
- **Technical Notes**: Important technical considerations
- **UX/UI Requirements**: User experience requirements
- **Performance Criteria**: Any performance requirements

## User Story Categories:

Please organize stories into these categories:

### Epic Level Stories
- Large features that span multiple sprints
- High-level user goals and journeys
- Major system capabilities

### Feature Level Stories  
- Mid-sized functionality within an epic
- Complete user workflows
- Specific feature implementations

### Task Level Stories
- Small, specific pieces of functionality
- Individual screens or components
- Single user actions or interactions

## Story Examples:

For each story, provide examples like:

**User Story:**
As a registered user  
I want to reset my password via email  
So that I can regain access to my account if I forget my password

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm on the login page
- When I click "Forgot Password" and enter my email
- Then I receive a password reset email within 5 minutes
- Given I click the reset link in the email
- When I enter a new password (meeting requirements)
- Then my password is updated and I can log in
- Given the reset link is older than 24 hours
- When I try to use it
- Then I see an error message and can request a new link

## Additional Considerations:

Please ensure stories are:
- **Independent**: Can be developed and tested separately
- **Negotiable**: Can be discussed and refined
- **Valuable**: Provide clear business value
- **Estimable**: Can be sized and planned
- **Small**: Can be completed in a reasonable timeframe
- **Testable**: Have clear acceptance criteria

## Story Refinement:
- Group related stories into epics
- Identify dependencies between stories
- Suggest story splitting for large stories
- Recommend prioritization based on value and dependencies

Focus on creating stories that are actionable, testable, and provide clear value to users.

## Tips for Better Results:

- **Include user personas** or types if you have them defined
- **Be specific about workflows** and user journeys you want to support
- **Mention any existing features** that new stories should integrate with
- **Include business constraints** or rules that affect functionality
- **Specify your development methodology** (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
