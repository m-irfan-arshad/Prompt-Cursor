- **Backend**: Framework and language choice
- **Database**: Primary and caching solutions  
- **Infrastructure**: Hosting and deployment
- **Additional Tools**: Testing, monitoring, etc.

### 2. Alternative Options
- Present 2-3 different stack options
- Compare pros/cons of each approach
- Highlight trade-offs between options

### 3. Decision Factors
- Why this stack fits your requirements
- How it handles your scale expectations
- Learning curve and development speed
- Community support and ecosystem
- Long-term maintenance considerations

### 4. Getting Started Roadmap
- Learning path if new technologies are involved
- Order of implementation (what to build first)
- Key resources and documentation
- Potential pitfalls to avoid

### 5. Future Considerations
- How well this stack will scale
- Migration paths if requirements change
- Technology longevity and community health

Please ask clarifying questions if you need more details about any aspect of the project or requirements.

## Tips for Better Results:

- **Be honest about your experience level** with different technologies
- **Include specific features** that might influence technology choice
- **Mention any existing systems** that need integration
- **Consider your deployment environment** - cloud vs on-premise
- **Think about the project lifespan** - quick prototype vs long-term product
