- [Incident Response](./incident-response.md)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Identify your maintenance need**
2. **Select the appropriate prompt template**
3. **Provide system details and current state**
4. **Use with your preferred AI tool**
5. **Implement and monitor the solution**

## üí° Tips

- Establish baseline metrics before optimization
- Document all maintenance procedures
- Test recovery procedures regularly
- Monitor for trends and patterns
- Plan maintenance windows carefully
- Keep security patches up to date

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### From Planning Phase
- Use infrastructure requirements from [Planning](../Planning/) prompts
- Incorporate monitoring needs from architecture design
- Consider maintenance requirements in system planning

### To Development Phase
- Provide monitoring insights for [Development](../Development/) teams
- Share performance optimization recommendations
- Guide debugging efforts with log analysis

### To Deployment Phase
- Ensure monitoring is included in [Deployment](../Deployment/) strategies
- Validate performance before production deployment
- Include maintenance procedures in deployment documentation

### To Documentation Phase
- Document maintenance procedures using [Documentation](../Documentation/) prompts
