- Compliance Requirements: [regulatory frameworks]
- Threat Landscape: [primary threats]
- Risk Tolerance: [risk appetite]

Current State:
- Existing Security Controls: [current measures]
- Security Incidents: [recent incidents]
- Compliance Status: [current compliance]
- Technology Stack: [current technologies]
- Security Team: [team size and expertise]

Requirements:
- [security requirements]
- [compliance requirements]
- [performance requirements]
- [usability requirements]
- [budget constraints]

Please provide:
1. Security Architecture Framework
