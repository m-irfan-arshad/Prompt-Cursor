Goal

I'm trying to build a simplified PowerBI-like dashboard tool in Next.js. The core functionality would allow users to create and customize their own interactive dashboards without coding. Users should be able to add different visualization widgets (charts, graphs, stats), configure what data they display, resize/position them, and save their customized dashboards. The implementation doesn't need complex features like advanced data processing or complex visualizations - just the fundamental ability for users to build their own dashboards with basic filters and variables to analyze their data through a clean, intuitive web interface.


Features that I want.


Basic data visualization - Charts and graphs that display data clearly
User-configurable widgets - Ability to add/remove different visualization types
Custom variables/filters - Options to filter or segment data on the fly
Self-service dashboard creation - Users can build their own dashboards without coding
Drag-and-drop interface - Intuitive placement and sizing of visualization components
Dashboard persistence - Saving customized dashboards for future use
Simplified implementation - Not overly complex or requiring advanced technical knowledge
Web-based interface - Accessible through a browser using Next.js
Interactive elements - Clickable components that respond to user interaction
Minimal setup required - Can be implemented quickly without extensive configuration
