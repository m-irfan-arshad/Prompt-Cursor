- How this fits into the broader market

## 4. Target Users & Personas
- Primary user segments
- User personas with demographics, goals, and pain points
- User journey mapping

## 5. Functional Requirements
- Core features (MVP)
- Advanced features (future releases)
- User stories with acceptance criteria

## 6. Technical Requirements
- Platform considerations
- Performance requirements
- Security and compliance needs
- Integration requirements

## 7. Design & UX Considerations

- User experience goals
- Accessibility requirements

## 8. Success Metrics & KPIs

## Tips for Better Results:

- **Include context** about your industry, competition, and market
- **Mention your resources** (team size, budget, timeline)
- **Specify your platform** (web, mobile, desktop, etc.)
- **Reference similar products** that you admire or want to differentiate from
- **Be clear about scope** - is this an MVP or full product?
