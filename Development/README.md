# Development Phase Prompts

This folder contains prompts for active development work - writing code, reviewing implementations, debugging issues, and refactoring existing code. These are the prompts you'll use most during the implementation phase of your project.

##  Available Prompts

### Code Creation & Generation
- **[Code Generation](./code-generation.md)** - Generate boilerplate code, components, and structures
- **[Code Review](./code-review.md)** - Get comprehensive feedback on your code quality

### Code Improvement
- **[Refactoring Assistant](./refactoring-assistant.md)** - Systematically improve existing code structure and quality

### Problem Solving
- **[Debugging Assistant](./debugging-assistant.md)** - Systematic approach to finding and fixing bugs

##  When to Use Development Prompts

### Writing New Code
- **Code Generation** when you need to create new components, functions, or modules
- Use this for boilerplate code, API endpoints, UI components, etc.

### Reviewing Your Work
- **Code Review** before committing important changes
- Use this to get feedback on code quality, security, and best practices

### Improving Existing Code
- **Refactoring Assistant** when code works but needs improvement
- Use this for cleaning up technical debt, improving performance, or enhancing maintainability

### Fixing Issues
- **Debugging Assistant** when you encounter bugs or unexpected behavior
- Use this for systematic problem-solving and root cause analysis

##  Development Workflow

A typical development workflow using these prompts:

1. **Generate** → Use Code Generation to create initial implementations
2. **Review** → Use Code Review to validate your approach
3. **Debug** → Use Debugging Assistant when issues arise
4. **Refactor** → Use Refactoring Assistant to improve code quality
5. **Review Again** → Final code review before completion

##  Tips for Development

### Code Generation
- Be specific about requirements and constraints
- Include examples from your existing codebase
- Specify coding standards and conventions

### Code Review  
- Include relevant context about the project
- Mention specific concerns or areas of focus
- Ask for prioritized feedback (critical vs. nice-to-have)

### Debugging
- Include complete error messages and stack traces
- Describe steps to reproduce the issue
- Mention what you've already tried

### Refactoring
- Clearly state your refactoring goals
- Include the full context of the code
- Specify any constraints (backward compatibility, etc.)

##  Integration with Other Phases

- **From Planning**: Use architecture decisions to guide code generation
- **To Testing**: Generate tests using [Testing Phase](../testing/) prompts
- **To Documentation**: Document your code using [Documentation Phase](../documentation/) prompts
- **To Deployment**: Prepare for deployment using [Deployment Phase](../deployment/) prompts

##  Quick Reference

| I want to... | Use this prompt |
|--------------|----------------|
| Create new code from scratch | Code Generation |
| Get feedback on my code | Code Review |
| Fix a bug or error | Debugging Assistant |
| Improve working code | Refactoring Assistant |

##  Next Steps

After development work:
- Use [Testing Phase](../testing/) prompts to create comprehensive tests
- Use [Documentation Phase](../documentation/) prompts to document your code
- Use [Deployment Phase](../deployment/) prompts to ship your code
