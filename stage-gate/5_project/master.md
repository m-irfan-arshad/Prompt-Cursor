Basic Workflow

Start in the Backlog:

There is 6 files in the backlog. we are going to complete them 1 by 1.

your job for a feature is to first move the file to the 1_planning from the backlog and then add stage_gate_plan. You will then implement that feature and the stage_gate_plan.

In the same request you will move on after that is completed, by moving the folder that has been created to 2_in_progress and add stage_gate_prod

then once that has been done you will move the completed feature folder to 3_completed/
Trigger the completion stage gate
