## Copy This Prompt:

I have existing project requirements/documentation that needs refactoring into a comprehensive, well-structured PRD. Please help me improve and reorganise this content.

Here's my current documentation:
[PASTE YOUR EXISTING REQUIREMENTS/DOCUMENTATION HERE]

Please refactor this into a professional PRD with the following improvements:

## Analysis & Feedback
First, provide feedback on the current documentation:
- What's well-defined and what's missing?
- Are there any ambiguities or inconsistencies?
- What assumptions need to be validated?
- Are the requirements feasible and well-scoped?

## Improved PRD Structure
Then create an improved version with:

### 1. Clear Problem Definition
- Refined problem statement
- User pain points clearly articulated
- Market opportunity quantified where possible

### 2. Well-Defined Success Criteria
- Specific, measurable goals
- Key performance indicators
- Success metrics and how they'll be tracked

### 3. Structured Requirements
- Functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- Prioritised feature list (must-have vs nice-to-have)

### 4. User-Centered Design
- Clear user personas and journeys
- Use cases with detailed scenarios
- Edge cases and error handling

### 5. Technical Considerations
- Architecture and technology recommendations
- Integration requirements
- Scalability and performance needs

### 6. Implementation Planning
- Development phases and milestones
- Dependencies and potential blockers
- Risk assessment and mitigation

### 7. Missing Elements
- Identify and add any missing critical sections
- Suggest additional research or validation needed

Please highlight the key changes you've made and explain your reasoning for major restructuring decisions.
