## Copy This Prompt:

```
I need help designing the system architecture for my project. Please help me create a comprehensive architecture plan.

## Project Context:
- **Project Type**: [Web app / Mobile app / API / CLI tool / etc.]
- **Expected Scale**: [Number of users, requests per second, data volume]
- **Key Requirements**: [Real-time features, offline support, integrations, etc.]
- **Constraints**: [Budget, timeline, team expertise, existing systems]

## Architecture Design Request:

Please provide a detailed architecture design that covers:

### 1. High-Level Architecture
- Overall system architecture diagram (describe the components)
- Key architectural patterns and principles
- Technology stack recommendations with justification

### 2. System Components
- Frontend architecture (if applicable)
- Backend/API architecture  
- Database design and data flow
- External service integrations
- Caching strategy

### 3. Scalability & Performance
- How the system will handle growth
- Performance bottlenecks and solutions
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing considerations

### 4. Security Architecture
- Authentication and authorisation approach
- Data protection and encryption
- API security considerations
- Common security vulnerabilities and mitigations

### 5. Development & Deployment
- Development environment setup
- CI/CD pipeline architecture
- Deployment strategy (cloud provider recommendations)
- Monitoring and logging approach

### 6. Alternative Approaches
- Discuss 2-3 different architectural approaches
- Pros and cons of each approach
- Recommendation with clear reasoning

### 7. Implementation Phases
- Break down the architecture into development phases
- Dependencies between components
- MVP vs full implementation considerations

Please be specific about technology choices and provide reasoning for major architectural decisions. Ask clarifying questions if you need more information about requirements or constraints.

## Tips for Better Results:

- **Be specific about scale** - include expected user numbers and usage patterns
- **Mention existing systems** that need integration
- **Include performance requirements** - response times, throughput, etc.
- **Specify your team's expertise** - what technologies are you comfortable with?
- **Note regulatory requirements** - GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
