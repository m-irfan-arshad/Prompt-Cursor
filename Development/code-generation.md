## Copy This Prompt:

```
I need help generating code for my project. Please create well-structured, production-ready code that follows best practices.

## Code Generation Request:
- **What to generate**: [Component, function, class, API endpoint, etc.]
- **Technology stack**: [React, Vue, Python, Node.js, etc.]
- **Functionality**: [Detailed description of what the code should do]
- **Requirements**: [Any specific requirements or constraints]

## Context:
- **Project type**: [Web app, API, CLI tool, etc.]
- **Existing patterns**: [Any code patterns or conventions I should follow]
- **Dependencies**: [Libraries or frameworks I'm using]
- **Style preferences**: [Any specific coding style or architecture preferences]

## Code Generation Guidelines:

Please generate code that includes:

### 1. Complete Implementation
- Full, working code that can be used immediately
- All necessary imports and dependencies
- Proper error handling where appropriate
- Type definitions (TypeScript/Python type hints)

### 2. Best Practices
- Follow language and framework conventions
- Use proper naming conventions
- Include appropriate comments and documentation
- Implement security best practices
- Optimize for performance where relevant

### 3. Code Structure
- Organize code logically with clear separation of concerns
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Make code modular and reusable
- Follow SOLID principles where applicable

### 4. Additional Features
- Include proper validation and error handling
- Add logging where appropriate
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Make code testable and maintainable

### 5. Documentation
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Include JSDoc/docstrings for functions and classes
- Provide usage examples
- Explain any complex algorithms or patterns

## Specific Requests:

Based on what I'm generating, please also provide:

### For Components (React/Vue/Angular):
- Props/data interface definitions
- Event handlers and lifecycle methods
- Styling structure (CSS classes, styled-components, etc.)
- Accessibility considerations
- Usage examples

### for API Endpoints:
- Request/response schemas
- Input validation
- Error handling and status codes
- Authentication/authorization if needed
- Documentation/OpenAPI specs

### For Functions/Classes:
- Input/output type definitions
- Error handling and edge cases
- Unit test examples
- Performance considerations
- Usage documentation

### For Database/ORM Code:
- Schema definitions
- Migration scripts if needed
- Query optimizations
- Data validation
- Connection management

## Additional Considerations:
- Make the code production-ready
- Include security considerations
- Optimize for maintainability
- Consider scalability implications
- Follow the project's existing architecture

Please ask clarifying questions if you need more specific details about the requirements or context.

## Tips for Better Results:

- **Be very specific** about what you want generated
- **Include examples** of similar code from your project
- **Mention your experience level** so complexity can be tailored
- **Specify any constraints** - performance, compatibility, etc.
- **Include your project's coding standards** and conventions
